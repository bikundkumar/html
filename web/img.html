            But down there it would be dark now, and not the lovely lighted aquarium she
                imagined it to be during the daylight hours, eddying with with schools of tiny,
                delicate amimals floating and dancing slowely to their own serene currents
                and creating the look of a living painting. That was wrong, in any case. The
                ocean was different from an aquarium, which was an artifical enviroment.
                The ocean was a world. And a world is not art. Dorothy thought about the living things that mooved in that world: large, ruthless and hungry.
