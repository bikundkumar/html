      It steals into my heart
    </p>
    <pre>
        There was a time when I loved
        The fantastic fabrics of the mind.
        There was a time
        When I lived my life
        Based on culled fictions.
        There was a time
        When I was satisfied
        With a fragment of reality,
        Splintered, broken and smashed.
        But now a lucid illumination
        Steals into my heart.
        The eternal Presence
        Of Infinity’s Light
        Feeds my Vision’s Dawn.
